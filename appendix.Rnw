For this master thesis, I created two R packages to help me in the analysis and in the related experiments. These packages are available, under open-source software license, through my GitHub account. Names are ”Random walk”  (https://github.com/AnthonyTedde/RandomWalk) and ”Stock price simulator” (https://github.com/AnthonyTedde/StockPriceSimulator).

The R package ”Random walk” contains functions that simulate time-discretized Brownian motions. It is widely used inside ”Stock price simulator”, mainly to add noise in the simulation of stock price time series. 

Unlike "Random walk", the package "Stock price simulator" is more multipurpose. The algorithms I developed inside range from the simulation of stock price path to the computation of option fair price and include hedging strategies, Greeks computation, Itô's approximation, characteristic functions and so on.

\Cref{sec:r:time} describes the functions inside the ”Stock price simulator” package that simulate time series by using a time discretization approximation.

\subsection{Geometric Brownian motion}
\label{sub:r:time:geometric}

Based on \cref{eq:underlying:geometric:closed}, this function provides one possible path of a time-discretized version of the geometric Brownian motion.
It outputs a R data.frame comprised of two columns, namely "time\_periods" and "stock\_price\_path", which respectively denotes the period expressed in year and the corresponding value of the stock at that time.

\subsubsection*{function}

       seed, scale, sigma, alpha)

\subsubsection*{Arguments}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
  initial\_stock\_price & Price of the stock at time zero.\\
  time\_to\_maturity & Duration of the simulation, expressed in year.\\
  seed & Parameter that fixes initial value of the pseudo random number generation in order to get reproducible experiment. \\
  scale & Number of time steps. For instance scale = 365 would mean daily measurement.\\
  sigma & Annualized volatility rate. \\
  alpha & Annualized drift rate.

\subsection{Merton Mixed jump-diffusion}
\label{sub:r:time:merton}

Based on \cref{eq:other:merton:pde}, this function provides one possible path of a time-discretized version of the Merton Mixed jump-diffusion model.
It outputs a R data.frame comprised of three columns. 
There are "time\_periods" ,"stock\_price\_path" which respectively denotes the period expressed in year and the corresponding values of the stock at that time.
In addition, the variable "grp" stand for "group" and allows to regroup the time series by jumps. Hunder the hood, a number, which is initialized to 0, is incremented as soon as a jump occurs, in this way, a whole series with the same number means that no jump occurred during its course.

\subsection{Heston stochastic volatility}
\label{sub:r:time:heston}

Based on \cref{eq:other:hsvvol,eq:other:hsvstock,eq:other:rho}, this function provides one possible path of a time-discretized version of the Heston stochastic volatility model.
It outputs a R data.frame comprised of five columns. 
There are "time\_periods" ,"stock\_price\_path" and "CIR", which respectively denotes the period expressed in year the corresponding values of the stock and of the volatility at that time.
In addition, the two more variables ”B1” and ”B2” stand for the Brownian motions that bring the noise in both stochastic processes $S(t)$ and $V(t)$.
