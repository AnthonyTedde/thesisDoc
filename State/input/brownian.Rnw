\subsection{Brownian Motion}

Before going further a gentle reminder of what is a brownian motion and how it is
computed would probably be apprectiate especially since it will become a 
master piece in subsequent computation.

A brownian motion is the continuous in time and in variable version of a scaled 
symmetric random walk. Basicaly At any time $t+1$ a random walk can take two variables 
contingent on an experiment realized at $t$, such as throwing a two fair coins.
The idea that the coin is fair is crutial in the determination of the next step 
value because of the symmetry of the random walk.

Moreover the symmetry underly another key aspect inherited for random walk to brownian motion,
which is the martingale property. A martingale characterize a specific motion
involving in value through time with a constant drift rate of zero. It means that
the expectation of such of process always is its initial value.

I howerver no waste much time in the precise mathematical definition of what a random is.
Instead, modeling the browian motion seems to be crutial.

First of all the brownian motion has as initial value zero. According to what has been stated 
before about the martingale property of a brownian motion, one should expect to 
get zero in average by entering in a brownian motion process.

Secondly their increments are normally distributed in the value they could take from
a previous time and they also are normally distributed beteen them if nonoverlaped.

\begin{equation}
\Delta{W(t)} \sim N \left( 0, \Delta{t} \right)
\label{eq:BM.dist}
\end{equation}

As shown in (\ref{eq:BM.dist}) the more the delta time, the bigger the variance
of the brownian motion. It is easily explained by the idea that forcasting more distant
random data, following a time process, brings more uncertainty.

The concept of time process is key for a Wiener process and is closely attached
to that of filtration. A filtration is a collection of
$\sigma$ algebra $\mathcal{F(t)}$ indexed by time. 

At any time $t$ a brownian motion is said to be $\mathcal(F(t))$--measurable and
independent of futur increment as well. It means that all informations accessible
at time $t$ is sufficent to determine the value taken by the brownian motion
at that time -- it is resolved by the information at $t$. However at this precise
time $t$ there is no way to predict with one hundred percent of certainty 
the futur value taken by the motion of the Wiener process. 

These constrains meet what is call the weak form of market efficency and will
be a necessary feature for the modeling of stock price thicker, but I digress.
